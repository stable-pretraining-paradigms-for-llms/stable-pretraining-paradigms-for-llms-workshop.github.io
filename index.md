<b>Our workshop aims to develop stable pre-training paradigms for deep learning that ensure consistent performance and reliability across diverse models and tasks.</b>
</p>

<h1>Topic and Content</h1>

<p style='text-align: justify; font-size: 1em;'>
Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence by achieving remarkable performance across a wide array of tasks. However, the training processes of these models often encounter instability issues such as loss spikes, gradient vanishing or exploding, and convergence difficulties. These instabilities not only prolong training time but also affect the overall performance and reliability of the models. As deep learning systems become increasingly integral to various applications, establishing stable training paradigms is essential. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss and develop strategies for enhancing the stability of deep learning training. By focusing on aspects like data quality, optimizer selection, architectural innovations, and spike-awareness mechanisms, we aim to foster collaborations that lead to more robust and dependable deep learning models.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify; font-size: 1em;'>
We will cover a range of topics that contribute to the stability of deep learning training, including but not limited to:
</p>

<ol style='font-size: 1em;'>
  <li>
    <b>Data Quality and Preprocessing for Stability</b>
    <p style='text-align: justify;'>Investigating how high-quality, well-preprocessed data can enhance training stability. Topics include data cleaning, balancing, augmentation, and the impact of data diversity on preventing overfitting and promoting smooth convergence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Advanced Optimizers for Stable Training</b>
    <p style='text-align: justify;'>Exploring optimization algorithms that improve training stability, such as adaptive learning rates, momentum methods, and second-order optimizers. Discussion on how these optimizers can mitigate issues like loss spikes and facilitate consistent gradient flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Architectural Innovations Promoting Stability</b>
    <p style='text-align: justify;'>Examining model architectures that inherently support stable training and prevent vanishing or exploding gradients.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Spike-Awareness and Mitigation Techniques</b>
    <p style='text-align: justify;'>Developing methods to detect and respond to training instabilities in real-time, focusing specifically on loss spikesâ€”sudden increases during model training. These spikes can signal problems like vanishing or exploding gradients, overfitting, or inappropriate learning rates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Efficient Hardware Utilization for Stability</b>
    <p style='text-align: justify;'>Leveraging hardware accelerators and memory management strategies that support stable training of large models. Topics may include gradient checkpointing, mixed-precision training, and specialized hardware to handle extensive computations reliably.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Case Studies and Best Practices</b>
    <p style='text-align: justify;'>Sharing experiences from successful implementations of stable deep learning training, including challenges faced and solutions developed. This includes industry applications where stability was critical for deployment and performance.</p>
  </li>
